Title: Source Code Editors

Some of the programming languages we will cover in this course come
with their own source code editors that are part of an integrated development environment (IDE) but some of the
languages do not have an IDE and thus you need a standalone source code editor to read, write and edit your codes.

Note that you can NOT use word processing software (like Microsoft Word) to edit your source code. A source code
file consists of simple ASCI text, whereas the files created by word processing software have all kinds of other
information about the document formatting; they are also usually stored in binary rather than ascii form.

 Modern source code editors include features that making writing code easier such as syntax highlighting, indentation, autocomplete and brace or bracket matching.

 There are numerous freely available source code editors.  A few that we recommend are
