Here we collect general instructions and helpful links.

### Getting Set Up

Below are some guidelines for setting up your computing environment.

#### Installing python

Our course is intended for use with the [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/anaconda)
python distribution.

Sample code:

    :::python
    for x in range(10):
        print(x)

#### Installing MATLAB

You can acquire a MATLAB license and instructions for installing the softare by sending
an email to askit@ldeo.columbia.edu. MATLAB uses a license server on campus
and thus will only run when your computer is on the university network, or if you
remotely connect using the LDEO VPN server (see below).

#### VPN: Connecting to the University network will off-campus

https://vpn.ldeo.columbia.edu

At the OpenVPN log in screen.
Click on the drop down list and choose "Login".
Log in with your LDEO ID and Password.
After you have successfully logged in you will be able to download and
install the new "OpenVPN Connect" Client or download the new
configuration file.


### Getting Help

Your first stop for help should be the official documentation of the packages
you are using.
Reading documentation can be sometimes feel tedious if you just want a quick
answer.
But it is usually worthwhile, since it helps you reach a deeper understanding of
how a package is structured.
Here are some of the links to the official documentation of the python packages
we use in this course.
